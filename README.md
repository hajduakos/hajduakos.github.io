## About Me
Computer scientist located in Budapest, Hungary, currently pursuing PhD studies in the field of formal verification. Feeling the most comfortable at the intersection of theory and practice, where the latest research results come to life in real-world solutions.

## Research Interests
- Formal methods, model checking, abstraction, CEGAR
- Verification of software, smart contracts, transition systems and Petri nets
- Applying logic in verification, SAT/SMT, interpolation
- Experimental evaluation and comparison of verification algorithms

## Tools
- **[Solc-verify](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/solidity/tree/boogie/)**: Automated formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.
- **[Theta](https://github.com/FTSRG/theta)**: Generic, modular and configurable verification framework.
